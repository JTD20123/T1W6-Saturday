# T1W6-Saturday


# Python Term 1 week 6 Saturday Class

#  if-else Practice Activity

# Building a calculator
Build a calculator that takes 3 input from the user

# List
Multiple Variable can be stored in one variable. Each piece is called an element.

# Loops

Like Post Malone dscribes "Run away, but were running on circles"
Used to repeat a block of code mutiple times until a certain condition is met.

DRY Codinf Principle: Dont Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank

'if' condition  would decide wether or not to run the inteded block. whears,
Loops would decide how many times the user wants to run the intended block

# While LOOP
Iterates a block of code as long as its condition remains true,
providing repetative executiion.

Things to consider
    Can Enter the loop 
    Can exit the loop

## Range
Its a pre defines fucntion that generates a sequence of numbers

useful: Loops for iterating a specific number of times oer a sequence of number

range (1,2,3)

# For Loop
For each item in a sequence, execute the intended statements

for var-name in a sequence:

# Practice Example 1
Finding the sum of the first 10 numbers
list = [3,41,12,9,74,15]

# Loop control statements
control the flow of the loop, terminate the loop early if you want or skip over iteration

# break statement
Terminate loop immediately, moves to the next statement after the loop
## continue statement
skips the rest of the code insde the loop of the current itteration and moves to  the next iteration
